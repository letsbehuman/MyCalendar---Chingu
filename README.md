# eCalendar

With this App you can add dates and events, as well as delete them or modify them.
This app is part of a solo-project to participate in a Chingu Voyage 41 pre-work.
[See the demo](https://ephemeral-jelly-a50dd5.netlify.app/)

Tools that I used:

- React {useState, useEffect, useReducer, useContext}
- Sass
- LocalStorage

Things to work on:

- Create and implement a back-end
- Change year when you are at the last month and click next month
- Reconstruct modals view in one component
- Change the background according to the season
- Simplify the style script using Sass tools
